# CLI

Multicolour comes with a CLI to help you get started with your projects.

The `init` wizard will guide you through some common options and create content for you.

Run `multicolour init [target]` where target is optional or where you want to generate your project.

You'll be warned that it will bash (overwrite) any existing app in that directory and do you want to continue.

You'll then be asked for a few technology choices, use enter and space to select and progress.

Once you've answered the questions, it will spend a few seconds generating some files for you and display a message saying it has finished generating basic content for you and installing the dependencies of the project.

You can start your service by running `multicolour start` and visiting [http://localhost:1811/docs](http://localhost:1811/docs) to view your new API's documentation.

### Next steps?

Open your [target] in your favourite editor and get to the interesting part of your development.

### `multicolour version`

Returns the version string for Multicolour, E.G `0.5.2`

### `multicolour plugin-add [plugin]`

Add a plugin to this install of Multicolour, will install and save the plugin to your `package.json`. By default will only search for official plugins but passing the `--no_prefix|-np` argument will install non-officially supported plugins as well.

Does not currently update your `plugins` config in the `package.json` as some plugins are plugins for the server.

### `multicolour start`

Start your services, this command is really only useful if you are using the `package.json` based configuration as generated by the init command. Below is the default `package.json` for posterity.
