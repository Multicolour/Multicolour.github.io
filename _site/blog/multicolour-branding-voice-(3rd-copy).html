With a legitimate logo.Multicolour 0.4.0 is a massive release for the project. With many new features, bug fixes, performance and security fixes it’s by far the coolest release yet and it makes total sense that it comes with a new logo and new website to reflect the generation of this product.If you need branding done, I spent 2 weeks constantly thrilled by No Divide’s work and presentation. I can’t recommend them and their work enough ❤️Onto the next chapter of Multicolour,Dave Mackintosh ~ Creator of Multicolour."
