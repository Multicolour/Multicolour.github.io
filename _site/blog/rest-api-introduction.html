There are some big fish out there already making use of REST APIs and reaping the benefits of them even as you’re reading this blog post.What are REST APIs?So, what is a REST API?A REST API is an application programme interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to GET, PUT, PATCH, POST and DELETE data. A RESTful API—also referred to as a RESTful web service—is based on representational state transfer, an architectural style and approach to communications often used in web services development.according to http://searchcloudstorage.techtarget.comStraight-forward right? This definition lays out for you what REST API’s are as a bare bones concept, but let’s explore things in a little bit more detail.A Rest API makes use of a specific set of verbs;  GET (This will retrieve a resource.)  PUT (Updates or creates a resource.)  PATCH (Updates a resource)  POST (Create a resource)  DELETE (Pretty sure I don’t need to explain this one!)There is a presumption, when using these verbs, that all calls are stateless. What is meant by this is that nothing can be saved by the REST service between executions. This lack of retention however is not necessarily a bad thing.  In fact, it can be very useful when it comes to building web services.Stateless applications can scale more easily to fit load changes and can be redeployed if something goes wrong. The fact that nothing is remembered by the process makes REST APIs perfect for web usage. This is  because it’s much faster and more flexible.That’s the key really and the reason that REST APIs are taking over from traditional procedural design for web based development. They are faster and the flexibility of the stateless approach is infinitely useful when using web based processes.What are they for?Ok what is a REST API for though? Why use it? Well, we’ve covered that a bit in the section above. There are many benefits to using REST APIs for web-based applications. For example they open up channels for communication between the user and the host so that, in a way, they exponentially expand what is already there and what you already have.REST APIs are on the rise and, honestly, it’s only a matter of time before they’re an industry standard, replacing the old guard of procedural technologies. The reason for this is that REST APIs use less bandwidth which makes them more suitable for online and mobile use.They’re  perfect for mobile apps and games! An API is merely code that allows multiple programmes to manage and transform data in a centralised place.Consumers utilise REST the same way we speak to one another. It’s the language of the web. With online resources on the rise, particularly with cloud usage becoming more  widespread, APIs are becoming a way to connect a rising number of people to web services.If you’re building an API, It makes sense to ensure that you utilise the capabilities of REST to allow your users to connect and interact with your online services.What is great about REST APIs is that they provide the developer with a lot of flexibility and granularity by breaking down any transaction into a series of resources.The difficulty lies in their complexity.

<p>It’s time to talk about REST APIs. In my previous post, we spoke about Multicolour and focused on what our wonderful API generator can do for you. This time I thought it might be nice to delve a little more into REST API’s to show you what you could potentially be missing out on.</p>

<p>I’ve split this post into three sections;</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is a REST API?</li>
  <li>What are REST API’s for?</li>
  <li>Who’s using them?</li>
</ul>

<p>If I’m doing my job right, by the time we’re done you will all see the benefits of RESTful APIs and how their application can streamline and potentially boost your business. There are some big fish out there already making use of REST APIs and reaping the benefits of them even as you’re reading this blog post.</p>

<h1 id="what-are-rest-apis">What are REST APIs?</h1>

<p>So, what is a REST API?</p>

<p>A REST API is an application programme interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to GET, PUT, PATCH, POST and DELETE data. A RESTful API—also referred to as a RESTful web service—is based on representational state transfer, an architectural style and approach to communications often used in web services development.</p>

<p>according to <a href="http://searchcloudstorage.techtarget.com">http://searchcloudstorage.techtarget.com</a></p>

<p>Straight-forward right? This definition lays out for you what REST API’s are as a bare bones concept, but let’s explore things in a little bit more detail.</p>

<p>A Rest API makes use of a specific set of verbs;</p>

<ul>
  <li>GET (This will retrieve a resource.)</li>
  <li>PUT (Updates or creates a resource.)</li>
  <li>PATCH (Updates a resource)</li>
  <li>POST (Create a resource)</li>
  <li>DELETE (Pretty sure I don’t need to explain this one!)</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a presumption, when using these verbs, that all calls are stateless. What is meant by this is that nothing can be saved by the REST service between executions. This lack of retention however is not necessarily a bad thing.  In fact, it can be very useful when it comes to building web services.</p>

<p>Stateless applications can scale more easily to fit load changes and can be redeployed if something goes wrong. The fact that nothing is remembered by the process makes REST APIs perfect for web usage. This is  because it’s much faster and more flexible.</p>

<p>That’s the key really and the reason that REST APIs are taking over from traditional procedural design for web based development. They are faster and the flexibility of the stateless approach is infinitely useful when using web based processes.</p>
